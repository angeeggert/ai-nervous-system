# 🛠️ How to Build Your Nervous System (Step-by-Step)

> **"The Agent provides the Intelligence. You provide the Hands."**

This guide explains the workflow to turn your chaotic notes and screenshots into a structured, AI-readable Master Index.

## 🏗️ Phase 1: Setup (The Workspace)

Since the AI cannot access your hard drive directly, **file naming is critical**. You act as the librarian. When the AI asks for a file, you must be able to find it in seconds using your OS search (Spotlight, Windows Search, Linux Find).

### 1. Create your Folder Structure
Create a main folder (e.g., `MY_AI_BRAIN`) with the following subfolders based on the "Habitats":

*   `/00_Constitution` (Rules, Prompts, Core Goals)
*   `/01_Chronicles` (Chat Logs, History)
*   `/02_Concepts` (Ideas, Drafts, Theory)
*   `/03_Mechanics` (Code, Snippets, Manuals)
*   `/04_Library` (PDFs, External Books)

### 2. Initialize the Index
Copy the `Master_Index_Template.md` file into the root folder.
*   Edit the **QUICK ACCESS** table to reflect your most urgent needs.

## ⚗️ Phase 2: The Alchemy Loop (Digitization)

*Goal: Turn screenshots/images into clean JSON text files.*

1.  **Open a new Chat** (GPT-4o / Claude 3.5 / Gemini Pro).
2.  **Paste** the **Optical Alchemist (v3.0)** System Prompt.
3.  **Drag & Drop** your images into the chat.

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT: The Rule of 5**
> Do not overload the AI.
> *   **Batch Size:** Max **5 files** per run. If you upload 20 images at once, the AI will likely degrade in quality or skip files.
> *   **Conserve Quality:** Small batches ensure high-fidelity OCR.

4.  **Save the Output:**
    *   Copy the JSON code block.
    *   Create a text file on your computer.
    *   **Naming Rule:** Use the exact filename generated by the Alchemist inside the JSON (e.g., `Claude - Quantum Physics Summary.json`).
    *   *Why?* This ensures your OS search finds it exactly when the Agent requests it later.

## 🧭 Phase 3: The Mapping (Vectorization)

*Goal: Create the navigation entry for your Master Index.*

1.  **Open a new Chat**.
2.  **Paste** the **Astrolabe (v3.0)** System Prompt.
3.  **Paste** the content of your JSON files (from Phase 2).

> **⚠️ QUALITY ASSURANCE: The Count Check**
> LLMs can get "lazy" or "echo" previous results in long sessions.
> *   **Check:** If you pasted **3** JSONs, make sure you get **3** Index Blocks back.
> *   **Verify:** Glance at the "Public Intent". Does it match the file?
> *   **Reset:** If the bot starts hallucinating old entries, start a fresh chat window.

4.  **Copy** the resulting 3-line blocks.

## 🧹 Phase 4: The Filing (Curation)

*Goal: Insert the new entries into your Master Index.*

**Option A: Manual (Fastest for single files)**
1.  Open your `MASTER_INDEX.md`.
2.  Paste the block under the correct Habitat Header (e.g., `# ℋ_Concepts`).

**Option B: Automated (Best for batches)**
1.  **Open a new Chat**.
2.  **Paste** the **Index Curator (v3.0)** System Prompt.
3.  **Paste** your unsorted blocks AND your current Index (or the relevant section of it).
4.  The Agent will return the perfectly sorted Markdown code. Replace your file content with this result.

## 🚀 Phase 5: Usage (The Bridge Protocol)

Now you are ready to work.

1.  **Start a new Session** with your preferred AI.
2.  **Upload/Paste** your `MASTER_INDEX.md`.
3.  **The Prompt:** *"This is my external Nervous System. Use the Vector Legend to navigate. If you need a file, REQUEST it by name."*

### The Interaction Loop:
1.  **You:** "Help me refine my project idea."
2.  **AI:** (Scans Index) "I see `Draft_Project_Alpha` in your Concepts Habitat. Please upload: `Project_Alpha_v1.json`."
3.  **You:** (Search your PC for `Project_Alpha` -> Drag & Drop the file into chat).
4.  **AI:** (Reads file) "Okay, based on your previous notes..."

## 💡 Troubleshooting & Pro-Tips

*   **"The AI is asking for a file I can't find."**
    *   *Cause:* You likely renamed the file on your disk but didn't update the path in the Index.
    *   *Fix:* Use your OS search for keywords. Once found, update the Index to match the real filename.

*   **"The Astrolabe is repeating old entries."**
    *   *Cause:* Context pollution. The AI remembers the previous batch too strongly.
    *   *Fix:* Use a fresh chat window for every major batch (e.g., every 10 files).

*   **"The Index is getting too big for the chat window."**
    *   *Fix:* You have reached "Data Saturation". Use the **Fulgurit Generator** (from the Gardener's Handbook) to compress old logs into summaries, then delete the raw logs from the Index. Keep the Index lean.
